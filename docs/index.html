                    We are Year 2 Computer Science students studying at <a href = "http://www.hw.ac.uk">Heriot Watt University Dubai.</a> For our course Web Programming,
                    we have been assigned a project. The project is to create a web game using our knowledge of HTML,CSS and Javascript. The four of us have decided to create 
                    a game based on the 'last-man-standing' principle. Find out more about the group members and the game below.

                <p>
                    This is a space-themed game where each player controls a spaceship equipped with guns. The players are able to fly their spaceships 
                    around a large map and shoot other players they encounter. The objective of the game is to survive for as long as possible and take 
                    down the most spaceships. The last spaceship standing wins the game.
